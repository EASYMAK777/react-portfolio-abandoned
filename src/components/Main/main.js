            <p>I thought today, this would be our crazy painting. Leave a little area open here. Let's just do a painting that's fun. Art is an expression of self. That's what makes it fun! Just enjoy!

            If you comply with that rule, how can you go wrong? Now we'll fluff it. Your artist license gives you complete freedom. You can just go on and on and on. Very, very... let me say that one more time: very.

            Feel the power of the water. We want this swirling, churning actions here. That's the fun part of this whole technique. You can do anything that you want to do... you can move mountains! Always keep the brush moving.

            Give it a lift-upper. It doesn't take much, but you have to devote that time. We're looking for a nice, even distribution of color. That's pretty already, shoot... but we're not gonna stop there. See how easy that is?

            Talent is nothing more than a pursued interest. That's about all we need. People are so excited when they see this happen. All these little things make it interesting. We don't know exactly where this is gonna go, and we don't care at this point.
