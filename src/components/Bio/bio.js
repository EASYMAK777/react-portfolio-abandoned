                        <p>
                            I am Juan Flores. I am just a regular guy who lives a regular life. I decided to take coding bootcamp because I wanted a real career in which i can learn a skill as well a develop it. I want to make big impact for whichever employer I decide to work for.

                            Learning Code has been tough but rewarding. One of the best feelings in the world is over coming a challenge you struggled with, even if its just one line of code that breaks your work finding the answer is a rush.

                            Coding has been one of the toughest things I've done but im learning. I look forward to being able to progress this page as I continue my coding journey!

                            For those of you following my work, I look forward to showing you the progress I've made as an amature web developer!

                            HAVE A GREAT DAY!!
